![Implemented Features](https://img.shields.io/badge/Implemented-Hashing-green)


Welcome to Crabcrypt, a comprehensive cryptography library currently being developed in Rust.

## Status

The project is currently **under development**. As of now, the hashing functionality has been implemented.

## Features

Here are some of the main features that we plan to provide:

- A range of secure hashing algorithms including MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, and SM3.
- Support for multiple character encodings.
- Cipher options for advanced encryption and decryption methods (under development).
- Efficient and convenient APIs for developers.

## Implemented

### Hashing

Crabcrypt provides a set of hashing algorithms including:

- MD2
- MD4
- MD5
- SHA1
- SHA224
- SHA256
- SHA384
- SHA512
- SM3

More features will be implemented soon. Stay tuned!
